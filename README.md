## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CUBE CSS
- CSS RESET
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

On my next few projects, I need to go over concepts instead of haphazardly applying techniques. Most of my decisions came from an earlier project and I didn't fully understand most of my decisions there. I still want to periodically go back over this project and add small touches here and there, but for now, I am happy with my solution and the progress I made.

### Useful resources
